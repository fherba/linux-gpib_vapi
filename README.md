# linux-gpib_vapi
It intended to be a Vala binding for the linux-gpib library -- Pretende ser un binding de la biblioteca linux-gpib para Vala

As described in its web http://linux-gpib.sourceforge.net :
"The Linux GPIB Package is a support package for GPIB (IEEE 488) hardware. The package contains kernel driver modules, 
and a C user-space library with Guile, Perl, PHP, Python and TCL bindings. The API of the C library is intended to be 
compatible with National Instrument's GPIB library. The Linux GPIB Package is licensed under the GNU General Public License."

Thus, the linux-gpib.vapi file is a try to bring linux-gpib API to Vala programming language (https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Vala/About).

I hope this works.
